## What is mRemote NG?

**mRemote NG** is a powerful, open-source, tabbed, multi-protocol remote connections manager. It allows you to view and control all your remote sessions—such as **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), SSH, VNC, rlogin, Telnet, RAW, and HTTPS**—from a single, unified, and highly organized interface. Instead of juggling multiple standalone clients, **mRemote NG** consolidates everything into one application with a familiar tree-view and tabbed layout, drastically improving workflow efficiency for system administrators, IT professionals, developers, and support technicians.

The software saves significant time and reduces clutter by storing all your connection configurations (hostnames, credentials, protocols) in an encrypted file. With features like inheritance for default settings, fullscreen mode, SSH tunneling, and external tools integration, **mRemote NG** is a robust, free alternative to commercial remote management suites. Its active development and strong community support ensure compatibility with modern systems and security standards.
